    Soundodger’s gameplay is marketed as “deceptively simple” in that the only thing required is to dodge bullets, and in short,
    that’s what the game is. There are 3 main types of bullets to avoid. The normal bullet, the bubble, and the homing bullet.
    Some levels have hearts which (upon collection) award the user with achievements and extra levels. Like many other rhythm games
    however,the levels are incredibly difficult. There are over 40 levels that come with Soundodger and each soundodger level really
    tests the player’s hand eye coordination, reaction time and spatial awareness.
    <br><br>
    The gameplay in my opinion is quite entertaining at first, as opposed to a lot of games that currently exist, soundodger is unique.
    The bullets really sync up to the music and it feels amazing to play. I have noticed some framerate issues on 60fps mode as soundodger
    doesn’t do too well when handling a multitude of bullets at a time but other than that, the gameplay alone is addictive.
    <br><br>
    Soundodger gives the player and option to slow the level down upon holding the left mouse button, though this slows down the level,
    it penalizes the player by lowering their score and by crowding the playfield with even more bullets. In my opinion, such a mode is
    useless as upon hitting an object the game continues and the score decreases anyway.
    <br><br>
    A level editor is included in soundodger allowing the player the freedom to create and release their own levels. In a lot of games,
    I like having a level editor and community content as it grows a community and extends the life of the game. Custom levels come in the
    form of xml files which users can share all around the internet, what I don’t like is that there is no central place to download these
    levels and as a result, no in-client downloaded making custom level downloading much harder than it should be. Take for example the
    popular mobile game “geometry dash”, geometry dash make use of an in client downloader for levels, levels can also be rated and featured.
    This makes level downloading incredibly easy for beginners and I think a centralised place for downloading soundodger levels would
    really make the game better.
