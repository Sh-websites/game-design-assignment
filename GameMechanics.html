    When a level is completed, the player is rewarded with a percentage which dictates how many bullets
    have not hit the player. The higher the percentage, the better the play. Upon hitting an object,
    everything slows down before speeding back up again, penalizing the player with a lower score at the end.

    In terms of short casual gameplay, this is fine, however continually playing with this mechanic
    becomes boring. This points scoring system is so basic, rhythm games generally tend to have a
    creative scoring system with lots of different insights on how well the player is doing to compensate
    for the lack of advanced gameplay, take for example, a rhythm game called “osu!” the gameplay is
    extremely simple however the scoring system is so grand and diverse it keeps the player occupied,
    giving them a motive to play more. Soundodger lacks this, making the completion of levels unrewarding.
