<h1> What is soundodger+ </h1>
<br><br>
<p>
Soundodger is a bullet hell rhythm game developed by Michael “Bean” Molinari on adobe flash. The game was originally a flash game hosted on the adult swim games
website however it has grown into a full steam game available for purchase for 7 USD. The aim of the game is to clear levels by dodging bullets, some of which
move towards the center, some home on the player’s position.
