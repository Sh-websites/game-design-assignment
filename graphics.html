    Like a lot of other rhythm games, graphics is not where soundodger shines, it has no clear
    aesthetic and there isn’t any emphasis on art. The gameplay however is very pleasing to look at.
    Michael Molinari, the creator of soundodger said on his presskit for soundodger the following:
    <br><br>
    “Soundodger started out as an attempt to tackle music games from the angle of dance. In dodging the
    various bullet patterns in a level, the player is doing a dance throughout the stage, almost as if
    she is a slave to the music.” - Molinari 2013
    <br><br>
    The game does a very good job at imitating dance throughout the game utilising features such as time
    warping and even an animated cursor that blurs when it’s moved suddenly.
    <br><br>
    The menus look alright however the little animation it does when going through the different
    screens almost feels like a time robber. No elements of the game are natively skinnable.
